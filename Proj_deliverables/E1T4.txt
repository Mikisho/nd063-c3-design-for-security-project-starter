Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Instances have full access to the s3 buckets (have the same IAM policy assigned), which is not a best practice for security.
In this scenario, both servers could access s3 bucket including the secret recipes. Thus, IAM policy should be changed. 

# Poor practice 2
As per the architecture diagram, web server under public subnet can access s3 resource using the API keys.
This makes the resource more vulnerable to malicious attacks, which enables attacker to get data eaisly.
